Non-profit organization that helps the surrounding area by teaching underprivileged children the basics of self respect, confidence and respect. The website would include a page describing the morals of the school, one where pictures and videos could be shown, and another for a small scale shop. There would also need to be log in for the students and administrator privileges for the instructors. All profits are donated to a local church.

This website seeks to fulfill the customerâ€™s needs by creating a website with several pages in which the administrator can add photos and videos as well as inspirational quotes while his students can add comments. There will also be a restricted area that can be accessed by students which will include videos such as forms and other helpful things. In addition, there will be a page containing the school location and class times as well as a secure page with a shop. The stakeholders of this website are Thierry Rene and the Church of Christ.
